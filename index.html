                  information. For us to achieve this, we must make it easy and profitable
                  to share.

                  well as individual needs and preferences. To support this there must be

                  <h1>About us</h1>
                  <p>We founded Metaito in February 2019, after more than 4 years at NTNU. The initial idea was sparked in 2014 when we discovered the challenge of organizing our resources as new students. We have since then gone through several iterations of prototypes.</p>
                  <p>Through exploration of the problem, we have developed a vision. We want to give people control over their resources, help them organize information and facilitate sharing with others. We want to reduce distractions and improve focus.</p>
                  <p>"There is an app for everything" is a famous quote. Today we can add "web based" to the statement. But still, there is no single app for everything. We constantly juggle apps that we choose based on goals, preferences and context. We use several apps for similar goals and we often use them in multiple contexts, such as work and personal.</p>
                  <p>To solve these challenges we are creating a platform for organizing and sharing information and tools on the internet. Our plattform will let you organize any app, in other words it will help you juggle. We will let you use apps across contexts, as well as letting you use another one when it better suits your goals.</p>
                  <p>We want to create a distraction free environment where you can organize the internet in a way that makes sense to you, while utilizing the strengths of the community. We want to give you focus and collaboration, without compromise.</p>
